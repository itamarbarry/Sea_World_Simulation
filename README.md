# Sea World Simulation Project ⛱️🌞 

### Project Description
This project was completed as part of the **"Simulation"** B.Sc. course in the **Industrial Engineering & Management Department** at **Ben-Gurion University**.

It focuses on the modeling, simulation, and optimization of a water park's daily operations using **Discrete Event Simulation**. The project tracks the complete visitor journey - from arrival and reception to facility usage (slides, pools, and tours) and departure, while accounting for complex real-world constraints such as queue abandonment, staff break schedules and family splitting logic.

**Overall Project Grade: 97/100**

### Project Overview
- **Simulation Code:** Full Python implementation of the simulation, including event logic and entity management.
- **Object-Oriented Architecture:** Modular simulation design based on Object-Oriented Programming principles, with core classes representing park visitors, facilities, and events.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Parameter estimation for facilities' service times (Exponential and Normal distributions) using **MLE**. Goodness-of-fit testing via the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** test to ensure simulation accuracy.
- **Optimization Strategy:** Evaluation of operational improvements to the park using statistical tests and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Project Results
Evaluated a $200,000 investment in website development, marketing, and visitor benefits. The simulation projected that the investment would lead to:
- **Wait Time Reduction at Reception:** Decrease in average visitor wait times at reception by **72 minutes** through bottleneck optimization.
- **Revenue Growth:** An average daily revenue increase of **$126,940**, with a break-even point of less than **two operating days**.
- **Visitor Rating Improvement:** An increase of approximately **0.4 points** in average visitor satisfaction.

### Tools Used
- NumPy & SciPy (Statistical Analysis)
